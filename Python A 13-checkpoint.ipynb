    "Indexing refers to accessing a single element from a sequence object using its position or index. In Python, indexing starts from 0, meaning the first element of a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. We use square brackets [] to access a specific element at a particular index. For example, the expression my_list[0] returns the first element of the list my_list.\n",

    "Slicing, on the other hand, refers to accessing a subset of elements from a sequence object. It is done using a colon (:) to separate the start and end indices of the slice. The syntax for slicing is my_list[start:end], where start is the index of the first element to include in the slice, and end is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice. If start is omitted, Python assumes it to be 0, and if end is omitted, Python assumes it to be the length of the sequence"
