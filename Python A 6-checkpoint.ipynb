    "Exception processing is an important aspect of Python programming that allows developers to handle runtime errors and other unexpected conditions in a program. Here are three applications for exception processing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: The most common use of exception processing is for error handling. When a runtime error occurs in a program, an exception is raised, and the program stops executing. By handling exceptions, developers can catch errors and take appropriate actions to recover from the error, such as printing an error message, logging the error, or retrying the operation that caused the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Another important application of exception processing is for resource management. In Python, resources such as files, network connections, and database connections need to be opened and closed properly to avoid resource leaks and other issues. By using exception processing, developers can ensure that resources are closed properly even if an error occurs while the resource is in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow: Exception processing can also be used for control flow. By raising and catching exceptions, developers can control the flow of execution in a program. For example, a function might raise an exception to signal that a certain condition has occurred, and the calling code can catch the exception and take appropriate action based on the condition."

    "If an exception is not handled in Python, the program will terminate abruptly with an error message that displays the exception type, message, and traceback.

    "When an exception occurs in a Python script, there are several options for recovering from the exception and continuing execution of the script. Here are some of the most common options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch the exception: The simplest way to recover from an exception is to catch it using a try-except block. In this case, you wrap the code that might raise an exception in a try block, and then catch the exception in an except block. You can then handle the exception in the except block, log the error, and take other appropriate actions to recover from the error and continue execution of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retry the operation: If the error was caused by a transient condition, such as a network timeout or database error, you can retry the operation that caused the error. You can implement this by catching the exception and then retrying the operation in a loop until it succeeds, or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a fallback value: If the error was caused by a missing or invalid input, you can use a fallback value instead of the input. For example, if a function expects a numeric input, but the input is not numeric, you can use a default value instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graceful shutdown: If the error is severe and cannot be recovered from, you may need to shut down the program gracefully to avoid leaving the program in an inconsistent state. In this case, you can catch the exception and then perform any necessary cleanup operations before terminating the program."

    "\n",
    "2.Using built-in functions or methods that raise exceptions:\n",
    "Many built-in functions and methods in Python raise exceptions if they encounter an error. For example, if we try to access an item in a list that does not exist, Python will raise an IndexError exception. Similarly, if we try to divide a number by zero, Python will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception"
