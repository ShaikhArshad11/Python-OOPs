    "Benefits:\n",
    "float is a built-in Python class that supports all the basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "float is faster and more memory-efficient than Decimal.\n",
    "float is the default data type for decimal numbers in Python, which makes it easier to use.\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "float is not precise when it comes to representing decimal numbers. This is because it uses binary floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to rounding errors.\n",
    "float cannot represent some decimal numbers exactly, such as 0.1, due to its binary nature.\n",
    "float is not suitable for applications that require high precision, such as financial calculations, where rounding errors can accumulate over time and lead to significant discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Decimal is a class in the decimal module that provides arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic, which means it can represent decimal numbers with arbitrary precision.\n",
    "Decimal is highly accurate and can perform arithmetic operations with high precision, making it suitable for applications that require high precision, such as financial calculations.\n",
    "Decimal provides explicit control over rounding modes and precision, which can help avoid rounding errors.\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "Decimal is slower and more memory-intensive than float.\n",
    "Decimal requires more code to use than float, and you need to import the decimal module explicitly.\n",
    "Decimal does not support all the built-in Python operations, and you need to use the decimal module's methods to perform arithmetic operations."
