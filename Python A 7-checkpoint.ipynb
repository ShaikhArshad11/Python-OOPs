If an exception occurs in the try block, Python checks if the exception matches any of the specified except blocks. If a match is found, the corresponding except block is executed to handle the exception. If no match is found, the exception is propagated up to the next level of the call stack.\n",

    "The try-finally block is used to ensure that a certain block of code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. The finally block is guaranteed to be executed even if an exception is raised in the try block or a matching except block. The finally block is typically used to clean up resources such as closing files, database connections, or network connections."
